# üì¶ Final Project Structure ‚Äì Secure Signing on Squads Protocol

This document explains the structure of all deliverables for the Secure Signing architecture project. Each chapter aligns with progressive security modeling ‚Äî from real-world incidents to a secure signing design.

---

## üß≠ Organization Philosophy

The structure follows a first-principles security lifecycle:

- Chapter 1: Understand how Squads works + failures that happen
- Chapter 2: Threat modeling (STRIDE + DREAD + novel attacks)
- Chapter 3: Secure architecture design for intents and signers
- Chapter 4: CLI specification (secure interface blueprint)
- Chapter 5: Project summary, index, and references

## üìÅ Intent Examples and Spec Location

These are stored under `Chapter 3`:

- `3.2.2 - txintent_spec.json`: Canonical schema
- `3.2.1 - tx_intent_specification.md`: Full rationale, hashing logic, fields
- `/intent_examples/transfer_usdc.json`: Sample transaction
- `/intent_examples/intent_hashing.py`: Reference hasher (optional)
