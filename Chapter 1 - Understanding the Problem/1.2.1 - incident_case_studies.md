### üß® **Case Study 1: Bybit (2025) ‚Äì Full-Stack UX Deception + Multisig Drift**

- **Summary**: North Korean APT (Lazarus Group) compromised multiple layers of Bybit‚Äôs multisig setup by **deceiving all signers through a spoofed web frontend**. All signers believed they were approving a routine USDC withdrawal. The actual tx routed funds to an attacker wallet.
- **Root Cause**:

  - **Frontend served from centralized infrastructure**
  - No **txintent hash** or canonical instruction validation
  - **Identical signer interface** for all signers (monoculture)
  - **API relay or browser compromise** possible

- **Security Breakdown**:

  - _Spoofing_: Fake UI showed benign tx
  - _Repudiation_: Signers denied intent, but logs were ambiguous
  - _Tampering_: Instruction buffer modified or masked
  - _No frontend hash verification_ (ICP or IPFS model absent)

- **Postmortem Insights**:
  - Similar vulnerabilities across WazirX, Phemex suggest systemic issue
  - **API-level data and UI were manipulated without onchain verifiability**

### üß® **Case Study 2: Harmony Bridge (2022) ‚Äì Low-Threshold Abuse**

- **Summary**: An attacker stole ~$100M by compromising **two of five signers** in Harmony‚Äôs multisig bridge contract. The attack leveraged the extremely low 2-of-5 threshold.

- **Root Cause**:

  - **Low signer quorum**
  - No signer diversity in geography or device
  - No tx approval audit trail

- **Security Breakdown**:

  - _Elevation of Privilege_: 2 signers enough to unlock full bridge
  - _No policy-layer gating_: All txs treated equally

### üß® **Case Study 3: Euler DAO (2023) ‚Äì Intent Mismatch from Governance UX**

- **Summary**: DAO signers accidentally voted to approve a proposal with **highly misleading metadata**. The frontend described the action as ‚ÄúStabilize Treasury,‚Äù but it implemented a critical governance change.

- **Root Cause**:

  - UX mismatch between **proposal description** and **onchain execution**
  - No use of intent schemas or structured voting

- **Security Breakdown**:

  - _Spoofing + Repudiation_: Voters acted on wrong assumption
  - _No `txintent` equivalent_ or out-of-band hash verification

### üß® **Case Study 4: BNB Chain Bridge (2022) ‚Äì Auto-Minting without Delayed Execution**

- **Summary**: BNB bridge was exploited to mint $570M via **unauthenticated messages** and **no delay between quorum approval and tx execution**.

- **Root Cause**:

  - No intent verification
  - No approval delay
  - No multi-stage review system

- **Security Breakdown**:

  - _Execution = Approval_ (no pause for audit)
  - _Tampering_: Message replay possibility

### üß® **Case Study 5: Safe{Wallet} UX Spoofing ‚Äì The Musking Problem**

- **Summary**: As described by DFINITY‚Äôs Dominic Williams, **Safe‚Äôs multisig UX was manipulated at the frontend level**, showing benign txs while actually authorizing malicious ones.

- **Root Cause**:

  - Safe‚Äôs UX not served from the blockchain
  - No way for signers to verify the UI‚Äôs content integrity

- **Security Breakdown**:

  - _Spoofing_: All signers were tricked by false UI
  - _No integrity hash for frontend UI_
  - _All signers used identical interface_ = monoculture risk

- **Mitigation Proposed**:

  - Use of ICP‚Äôs chain-hosted web experience
  - Cold frontends with hash-checking (IPFS/ICP)
