# âœ… Title â€“ Secure Signing Principles for Squads Protocol Secure Signing

## ðŸ”° OVERARCHING GOAL

**Protect signing operations against deception, drift, replay, and privilege escalation across the entire Squads multisig lifecycle.**

# âœ¨ Secure Signing Principles

---

### 1. **Intent-Hash Binding is Mandatory**

> _Every transaction must be cryptographically tied to a canonical, human-readable intent description (`txintent.json`)._

- **Why**: Prevents Intent Mismatch Reversal and Musked UX spoofing.
- **Defends Against**:
  - UI tampering
  - Proposal buffer swaps
- **Implementation**:
  - Hash (`SHA256(txintent.json)`) must match at UI and CLI
  - Signing must halt if hashes mismatch
- **Use Case**: Euler DAO incident, Bybit frontend spoofing

---

### 2. **Execution Must Never Be Implicit**

> _Approval and execution are distinct phases; execution requires explicit signer or executor action._

- **Why**: Prevents Threshold Drift Trojan and Auto-exec Abuse.
- **Defends Against**:
  - Silent threshold-based attacks
  - Approval-time trickery
- **Implementation**:
  - Timelocks by default
  - Executor role distinct from voters
- **Use Case**: BNB Chain hack (instant auto-mint after quorum)

---

### 3. **Signer Independence Must Be Logical and Contextual**

> _Signers must validate proposals independently, without assuming other participants validated correctly._

- **Why**: Prevents Ghost Signer Bot, All-Signer Deception.
- **Defends Against**:
  - Cross-signer compromise
  - Social layer attacks
- **Implementation**:
  - Multiclient policy (CLI + frontend)
  - Cold-mode operation possible
- **Use Case**: Bybit signers trusting same spoofed UI

---

### 4. **Frontends Must Be Trust-Verifiable**

> _User interfaces must be integrity-verified either onchain (ICP model) or by client-side hash verification._

- **Why**: Frontend attacks are now primary Web3 breach vectors.
- **Defends Against**:
  - Musked UX
  - Canonical Client Hash Bypass
- **Implementation**:
  - IPFS/ICP-hosted frontend
  - Client Hash (sha256) embedded into txintent
- **Use Case**: Safe UX compromise; DFINITY ICP proposal

---

### 5. **Plugin Execution Must Be Policy-Locked**

> _Vaults must enforce policy on modular plugin loading and execution to prevent privilege escalation._

- **Why**: Smart Plugin Hook Injection is a high-risk Squads-specific threat.
- **Defends Against**:
  - Dynamic privilege gain
  - Invisible attack surface extension
- **Implementation**:
  - Plugin whitelist enforced at vault config
  - Execution event logs must include plugin context hash
- **Use Case**: Squads Smart Accounts extensibility risks

---

### 6. **Signer Quorum Must Be Baseline-Locked**

> _Vaults must encode "original signer" logic, preventing gradual quorum erosion or signer rotation attacks._

- **Why**: Prevents Signer Rotation Loop and silent governance drift.
- **Defends Against**:
  - Progressive capture attacks
- **Implementation**:
  - Vault metadata: signer epoch IDs
  - Approvals enforce % of "original" signers
- **Use Case**: Harmony bridge low-quorum exploitation

---

### 7. **Execution Context Must Be Temporal, Not Just Logical**

> _Time, session, and blockhash constraints must bind signer approvals._

- **Why**: Expiry prevents stale txs from being re-signed or abused later.
- **Defends Against**:
  - Durable Nonce attacks
  - Replay attacks
- **Implementation**:
  - Blockhash expiry validation
  - Deny durable nonces unless explicitly authorized
- **Use Case**: OtterSec: Two-Minute Rule critique (last signer risk)

---

### 8. **APIs and RPCs Must Be Verifiable**

> _Metadata, buffers, and simulation results must be authenticated or locally simulated._

- **Why**: API-layer spoofing has occurred in Web3 (and suspected in Bybit).
- **Defends Against**:
  - Relay injection
  - Proposal metadata deception
- **Implementation**:
  - Hash-match APIs
  - Local simulation before signing
- **Use Case**: Bybit API relay manipulation suspicion

---

### 9. **Signer Activity Must Be Canonical, Immutable, and Minimal**

> _Every signer action must produce a minimal audit record tied to pubkey and tx intent._

- **Why**: Ensures forensic capacity without leaking excessive metadata.
- **Defends Against**:
  - Repudiation attacks
- **Implementation**:
  - `signer_log` = {pubkey, intent_hash, timestamp}
  - IPFS or lightweight storage
- **Use Case**: Harmony bridge signer ambiguity post-attack
