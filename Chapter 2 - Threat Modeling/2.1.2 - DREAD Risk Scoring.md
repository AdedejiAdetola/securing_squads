## üß© Additional Architectural Notes

- ‚úÖ Two-Minute Rule:

  - Works only against **timing-based reuse**
  - Fails if **last signer is compromised** or **durable nonce is used**
  - **Not a substitute** for content validation or execution control

- ‚úÖ ‚ÄúAll Signers Deceived‚Äù Pattern:
  - A _design-level monoculture_ failure
  - Implies all signers trust the same frontend, same metadata API
  - **Multiclient**, **airgapped**, or **OOB validation** is required
