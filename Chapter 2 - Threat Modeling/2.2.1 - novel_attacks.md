# Title – Novel Attacks Ideation

All scenarios include:

- Description
- Threat type (STRIDE)
- Exploit path
- Detection difficulty
- Mitigations
- Cross-mapping to Squads logic or incidents

---

### 🧠 1. **Intent Mismatch Reversal**

> UI shows “Transfer 500 USDC” — signer unknowingly approves a contract upgrade or governance action.

- **STRIDE**: Spoofing, Tampering
- **Exploit**: Replace proposal metadata or buffer contents after signer reads UI
- **Detection Difficulty**: High unless canonical intent hash is enforced
- **Mitigation**:
  - Canonical `txintent.json` schema
  - CLI must display semantic summary, not just hash
  - Require hash lock before approval

---

### 🧠 2. **Threshold Drift Trojan**

> A series of benign-looking txs reduce quorum threshold, enabling silent control shift.

- **STRIDE**: Elevation of Privilege
- **Exploit**: Chain of config txs slowly drops threshold (e.g., 4/6 → 3/6 → 2/6)
- **Detection Difficulty**: Medium unless policy or baseline quorum enforcement exists
- **Mitigation**:
  - Role-specific policy logic
  - Historical signer quorum snapshots
  - Signer alerting on quorum changes

---

### 🧠 3. **Proposal Buffer Switch**

> Attacker modifies instruction buffer post-approval but pre-execution.

- **STRIDE**: Tampering
- **Exploit**: Swap or alter serialized buffer using compromised relay/API
- **Detection Difficulty**: High — signatures remain valid
- **Mitigation**:
  - Instruction hash at approval
  - Vault policy enforcing pre-execution rehash
  - Enforce Git-tag matching for upgrade flows

---

### 🧠 4. **Ghost Signer Bot**

> CLI malware signs tx once other quorum members approve.

- **STRIDE**: Elevation, Repudiation
- **Exploit**: Signs on behalf of infected key when threshold is nearly met
- **Detection Difficulty**: Very high — signer denies intent
- **Mitigation**:
  - Require biometric or physical token (Ledger, YubiKey)
  - Timelock + quorum awareness: “Don't be last signer”

---

### 🧠 5. **Context Drift Mis-Sign**

> Signer rushes through queued proposals; attacker inserts a sensitive tx between benign ones.

- **STRIDE**: Spoofing
- **Exploit**: Cognitive fatigue exploited through proposal sequencing
- **Detection Difficulty**: Medium; most UIs offer no history diff
- **Mitigation**:
  - Cooldown timers
  - Diff-based UX alert: “This tx differs from the previous ones”
  - Quorum re-verification for high-value vaults

---

### 🧠 6. **Cross-Environment Key Drift**

> Same signer key used in Devnet and Mainnet due to misconfiguration or SDK confusion.

- **STRIDE**: Information Disclosure + Elevation
- **Exploit**: Devnet key gets phished and reused in mainnet vault
- **Detection Difficulty**: High without metadata tagging or vault segmentation
- **Mitigation**:
  - Key–vault environment locking
  - Metadata signing context
  - CLI enforcement of network segregation

---

### 🧠 7. **Upgrade Hash Switcheroo**

> Audit passed for Program A, but attacker swaps the program buffer to Program B before final execution.

- **STRIDE**: Tampering
- **Exploit**: Hash used in audit report ≠ buffer at execution
- **Detection Difficulty**: High without explicit buffer commit step
- **Mitigation**:
  - Buffer hash log at audit timestamp
  - Pre-execution hash diff required in UI/CLI
  - GitHub tag verification

---

### 🧠 8. **Signer Rotation Loop**

> Over time, malicious actors rotate in compromised keys without obvious tx footprint.

- **STRIDE**: Elevation of Privilege
- **Exploit**: Gradual signer addition/removal leads to attacker quorum
- **Detection Difficulty**: Low over short time; high over weeks/months
- **Mitigation**:
  - Signer lifetime policy: baseline quorum lock
  - Role-based signer flags: "original signer" tag

---

### 🧠 9. **Smart Plugin Hook Injection** 🆕

> A Squads plugin loads dynamic logic from an external URI or unverified source.

- **STRIDE**: Elevation + Tampering
- **Exploit**: Plugin executes untrusted code as part of `execute_transaction`
- **Detection Difficulty**: High — appears legit unless plugin registry is enforced
- **Mitigation**:
  - All plugins must be audit-locked
  - Plugin whitelist in vault config
  - Execution log must include plugin context hash

---

### ✅ 🧠 10. **Canonical Client Hash Bypass** 🆕

> UI hash submitted in `txintent` ≠ actual UI served due to CDN/JS injection.

- **STRIDE**: Spoofing
- **Exploit**: Frontend hash altered or incorrectly declared
- **Detection Difficulty**: Medium – depends on external tooling
- **Mitigation**:
  - CLI fetches actual IPFS hash and compares to `txintent`
  - Browser plugin (like ICP chain-key) validates frontend served to signer
